# Define a method meal_choice that returns the meal_choice that was
# passed into it and defaults to meat.

def meal_choice(meal="meat") #meal is argument, default argument is "meat"
  "#{meal}" #method returns #{meal}
end #end method


#this also works, but need to say 'return'
# def meal_choice(meal="meat") #meal is argument, default argument is "meat"
#   return meal #method returns #{meal}
# end #end method
